Flappy Bird Game (Unity)

A simple "Flappy Bird clone" developed using "Unity" and "C#", where the player controls a bird and tries to survive by avoiding obstacles while earning points.

Game Overview

In this game, the player taps or presses a key to make the bird flap upward. Gravity constantly pulls the bird downward, so precise timing is required to pass through the gaps between pipes. The game ends if the bird collides with an obstacle or the ground.

Features

* Classic Flappy Bird gameplay
* Smooth bird movement using "Rigidbody2D"
* Randomly generated pipes
* Score tracking system
* Game Over screen with restart option
* Simple and beginner-friendly Unity scripts

Technologies Used

* "Unity Engine"
* "C# Programming Language"
* "2D Physics (Rigidbody2D & Colliders)"
